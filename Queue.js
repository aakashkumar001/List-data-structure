// A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the
// front. Queues are used to store data in the order in which they occur, as opposed to a
// stack, in which the last piece of data entered is the first element used for processing.
// Think of a queue like the line at your bank, where the first person into the line is the
// first person served, and as more customers enter a line, they wait in the back until it is
// their turn to be served.
// A queue is an example of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. Queues are used to
// order processes submitted to an operating system or a print spooler, and simulation
// applications use queues to model scenarios such as customers standing in the line at a
// bank or a grocery store.

// Queue Operations

// The two primary operations involving queues are inserting a new element into a queue
// and removing an element from a queue. The insertion operation is called enqueue, and
// the removal operation is called dequeue. The enqueue operation inserts a new element
// at the end of a queue, and the dequeue operation removes an element from the front of
// a queue.
